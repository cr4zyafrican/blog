title: Jekyll Blog Start
---
Jekyll was a little complicated at first to configure but now it is up and running!

I took some general formatting ideas from the [Jekyll Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) project on GitHub, which aims to help you get up and running as fast as possible on Jekyll. But I didn't want all those options so I just took their ideas and composed my repository in a much more simple fashion.

I recieved some non-descript jekyll errors including `/' and got myself quite confused with different branches on the GitHub respository. I was changing branch protection settings when I meant to be changing which branch was the default one. 

But it's finally set up. I'm not sure what I will be using this blog for. Maybe walk throughs on how to set certain things up. That may be the next post. Until later!
